# Practical 06
# CP1404 Practical 06 - Reflection

**1. What did you learn this week?**  
This week I learned how to define and use classes in Python, including how to use `__init__`, `__str__`, and custom methods like `get_age()` and `is_vintage()`. I also learned the importance of using object-oriented design to model real-world things like cars, programming languages, and guitars.

**2. What did you find challenging?**  
The most challenging part was understanding the difference between instance variables and local variables inside methods. I also had to be careful about how string formatting is used when printing objects.

**3. What did you enjoy or do well?**  
I enjoyed creating and testing the Guitar class. It was interesting to build up the logic step by step and see how small methods like `is_vintage()` could make the program smarter.

**4. What would you like more help with?**  
I would like more practice with class design and testing. It’s still a bit tricky to know when to put certain logic into a method versus handling it in the main program.

**5. What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?**  
Next time, I will make sure to test each method immediately after writing it to catch any bugs early. I’ll also aim to use more meaningful docstrings and comments to explain my code.
