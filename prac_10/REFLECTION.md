# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

In the beginning, my time estimates were often inaccurate. I tended to underestimate how long debugging and testing would take.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the weeks went by, I became more familiar with the task structures and my workflow. I started giving myself more realistic buffers, especially for tasks involving GUIs or new libraries.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of planning and breaking down tasks into smaller chunks before diving into the code. Estimating helped me better manage my time and avoid last-minute rushes.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Receiving feedback helped me identify coding habits I didnâ€™t notice, like inconsistent naming or forgetting to add comments. It reminded me that code readability matters.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned to look beyond whether the code "works" and consider structure, maintainability, and clarity. Reviewing others made me reflect on my own style.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review for prac_05](https://github.com/ZHANGJIALELLLLL/CP1404_prac/pull/3#issuecomment-3077437780

)

### Explanation

In this review, I pointed out how their variable names could be clearer and suggested using a function to reduce code duplication. I also encouraged them to follow PEP 8 spacing rules.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review for prac_07](https://github.com/ZhongSihan/cp1404praticals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-3045315899)

### Explanation

I provided specific comments about improving the loop logic and simplifying a conditional expression. I also acknowledged what they did well in their class design.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more short videos explaining the purpose behind each task before students begin, especially for new topics like Kivy and Flask.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I stayed consistent with using Git, writing meaningful commit messages, and organising my code into reusable functions. I also completed every task and extended a few for extra challenge.
