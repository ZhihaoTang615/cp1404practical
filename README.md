### Lessons Learned about Clean Code

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each class and function should do one thing and do it well. For example, file reading is kept out of the class definitions.
- **Meaningful Naming**: Using descriptive variable, function, and class names makes the code easier to read and maintain.
- **Docstrings and Comments**: Proper documentation helps others (and your future self) understand what each part of the code does.
